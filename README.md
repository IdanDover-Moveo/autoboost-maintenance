# Init monday code

A nice template built with nestjs to build a monday code solution for your monday apps.

### Set Up

- Clone the repository
- Run "cd Init-monday-code"
- Run "npm install" in your terminal
- Delete the .git folder
- Create .env files for each environment(e.g. .env.development, .env.production)
- Enjoy ðŸ˜Š

### How to continue building the app

Currently this template uses heavily nest own solutions, so you can simply use the nest docs to look for guidance: https://docs.nestjs.com. We also suggest looking at the monday code docs if you want to extend any further: https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/hosting-your-app-with-monday-code

### Important

Please create the files

- .env.development
- .env.production

and fill up the environment variables in development according to your development solutions(e.g. ngrok) and the production should be according to the app variables that are displayed on monday.com
